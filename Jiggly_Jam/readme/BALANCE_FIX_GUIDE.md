# Balance Fix Implementation

## ✅ **Problem Solved: Character Not Standing Upright**

Your soft-body human character was collapsing because the physics simulation lacked proper **postural stability** and **weight distribution**. Here's what was implemented to fix the balance issues:

## 🔧 **Key Balance Fixes Applied**

### 1. **Postural Stability System** (`apply_postural_stability`)

#### **Foot Grounding**

- **Heavy feet**: Feet get 2.5x mass when near ground for stability
- **Ground adhesion**: Strong friction and reduced bounce for foot contact
- **Horizontal damping**: Reduces foot sliding when standing

#### **Spine Alignment**

- **Vertical correction**: Forces spine to stay mostly upright
- **Head-pelvis alignment**: Applies corrective forces to maintain posture
- **Prevents slouching**: Active counter-force against gravity collapse

#### **Center of Mass Balancing**

- **Base of support**: Tracks position between both feet
- **COM calculation**: Weighted average of all body part positions
- **Balance correction**: Shifts upper body weight over feet when off-balance

#### **Leg Straightening**

- **Standing preference**: Encourages straight legs when feet are grounded
- **Knee positioning**: Guides knees toward anatomically correct position
- **Prevents crumpling**: Maintains leg structure under body weight

### 2. **Improved Mass Distribution**

```cpp
// Strategic mass assignment for stability
FOOT_L/FOOT_R:    2.5f  // Heavy feet for grounding
ANKLE_L/ANKLE_R:  2.0f  // Stable ankle joints
KNEE_L/KNEE_R:    1.5f  // Weighted leg joints
SPINE_MID/PELVIS: 1.8f  // Heavy torso (body weight)
HEAD:             1.3f  // Moderate head weight
HAND_L/HAND_R:    0.8f  // Light hands for mobility
FLESH (NONE):     0.5f  // Light flesh points
```

### 3. **Enhanced Ground Collision**

#### **Special Foot Handling**

- **Stronger damping**: Feet get 70% less bounce than regular body parts
- **Increased friction**: 1.5x ground friction for feet vs. other parts
- **Stability propagation**: When feet are grounded, whole body gets stability bonus

#### **Skeletal Damping**

- **Bounce reduction**: 5% velocity damping for skeleton points when grounded
- **Prevents oscillation**: Stops excessive soft-body bouncing while standing

## 🎯 **Expected Results**

### **Standing Behavior**

- ✅ Character stands upright on feet instead of collapsing
- ✅ Slight wobbling is maintained for "soft-body fun" but within limits
- ✅ Feet act as stable base of support

### **Movement Behavior**

- ✅ Character can jump and land back on feet
- ✅ Walking maintains upright posture during movement
- ✅ Recovery from impacts returns to standing position

### **Physics Behavior**

- ✅ Center of mass stays over base of support (between feet)
- ✅ Spine maintains mostly vertical alignment
- ✅ Legs extend to support body weight
- ✅ Natural-looking balance corrections

## 🔍 **Technical Implementation**

The postural stability system runs **every physics frame** in `Player::update()`:

```cpp
// Apply postural stability before physics update
figure.apply_postural_stability(this->ID, dt, ground_level);

// Then run normal physics
figure.update(dt);
```

### **Performance**

- **Minimal overhead**: Only affects points belonging to specific player ID
- **Conditional execution**: Most corrections only apply when needed (near ground, off-balance, etc.)
- **Smooth integration**: Works with existing physics without conflicts

## 📊 **Tunable Parameters**

The system includes several parameters that can be adjusted:

- **Foot stability force**: How "heavy" feet become when grounded
- **Spine correction strength**: How aggressively spine stays vertical
- **Balance sensitivity**: How much COM offset triggers corrections
- **Leg straightening force**: How much legs prefer to be straight

This creates a robust foundation where your character will naturally stand upright while maintaining the fun, wobbly soft-body physics you want for gameplay!
