# Human Figure Fix - Proper Skeleton vs Flesh

## Problems Fixed

### 1. **Too Many Skeleton Points**

- **Before**: Every perimeter point was tagged with a BODY_PART, creating dozens of "skeleton" joints
- **After**: Only 16 key anatomical landmarks are tagged as skeleton joints
- **Result**: Clean skeleton structure with proper joint connections

### 2. **Unrealistic Proportions**

- **Before**: Awkward proportions with limbs extending too far
- **After**: Anatomically correct proportions based on real human measurements
- **Result**: Natural-looking human silhouette

### 3. **Poor Shape Definition**

- **Before**: Connected only joint-to-joint, creating angular, robotic outline
- **After**: Smooth human silhouette with proper curves and body shape
- **Result**: Realistic human figure that looks natural

## New Human Figure Design

### Skeleton Joints (16 total)

- **HEAD**: Top of skull
- **NECK**: Base of neck/top of torso
- **SHO_R/L**: Shoulder joints
- **ELB_R/L**: Elbow joints
- **HAND_R/L**: Wrist/hand endpoints
- **WAIST_R/L**: Waist/core connection points
- **HIP_R/L**: Hip joints
- **KNEE_R/L**: Knee joints
- **FOOT_R/L**: Ankle/foot endpoints

### Flesh Points (30+ additional)

- Head curves and facial outline
- Neck-shoulder transitions
- Torso sides and armpit areas
- Upper/lower arm curves
- Thigh and calf muscles
- Foot and bottom outline
- **All tagged as BODY_PART::NONE**

## Visual Improvements

### In Debug View

- **Red springs**: Now show only the core 16-joint skeleton
- **Cyan springs**: Connect interior flesh to skeleton joints
- **Gray springs**: Regular mesh connectivity

### Proportions

- Height scaled to realistic human ratios (180cm base)
- Shoulder width: ~50cm
- Arm length: Realistic reach
- Leg proportions: Proper thigh/calf ratios
- Head size: Proportional to body

## What You'll See Now

1. **Skeleton springs (red)** form a clean stick-figure skeleton
2. **Human silhouette** looks like an actual person
3. **Flesh stays attached** to skeleton but remains bouncy
4. **Natural movement** with proper joint articulation
5. **Stable structure** that doesn't collapse

## Key Changes Made

### Player.cpp - Human class

```cpp
// Before: 18 skeleton joints (too many)
// After: 16 anatomical skeleton joints + 30+ flesh outline points

// Better proportions
s = height / 180.f; // More realistic scaling

// Proper silhouette with curves
outline = {
    {HEAD, BODY_PART::HEAD},
    {curved_outline_point, BODY_PART::NONE}, // Flesh points
    {SHO_R, BODY_PART::SHO_R},              // Skeleton joints
    // ... smooth human outline
};
```

The result is a human figure that:

- ✅ Has proper human proportions
- ✅ Uses only key skeleton joints for structure
- ✅ Maintains flesh attachment to skeleton
- ✅ Looks and moves naturally
- ✅ Retains the fun bouncy physics
