# Skeleton + Flesh Spring System Implementation

## What Was Added

### Core Implementation

1. **`connect_flesh_to_skeleton()` method** in `jelly.hpp`:

   - Connects interior/flesh points to nearest skeleton joints
   - Uses configurable parameters: stiffness (0.35f), k-nearest (2), max distance (60f)
   - Prevents duplicate springs and handles edge cases

2. **Integration into skeleton creation**:

   - `add_skeleton_for_player()` now automatically calls `connect_flesh_to_skeleton()`
   - Skeleton springs use high stiffness (2.0f) for structural integrity
   - Flesh-to-skeleton springs use lower stiffness (0.35f) for flexibility

3. **Updated Player creation**:
   - `Player::create_figure()` now calls `add_skeleton_for_player()` after creating the filled polygon
   - This ensures both skeleton and flesh connections are established

## How It Works

### Two-Tier System

- **Skeleton Layer**: Strong springs (red in debug view) connecting BODY_PART joints
  - High stiffness (2.0f) maintains overall human shape
  - Connects head→neck, neck→shoulders, shoulders→elbows, etc.
- **Flesh Layer**: Soft springs (cyan in debug view) connecting interior points to skeleton
  - Lower stiffness (0.35f) allows for squishy, bouncy behavior
  - Each interior point connects to 2 nearest skeleton joints within 60 pixels
  - Prevents flesh from falling away from the skeleton

### Parameters You Can Tune

- `skeletonStiffness`: How rigid the main body structure is (default 2.0f)
- `fleshToSkeletonStiffness`: How soft the flesh attachment is (default 0.35f)
- `k`: Number of skeleton joints each flesh point connects to (default 2)
- `maxDistance`: Maximum distance for flesh-skeleton connections (default 60f)

## Debug Tools

### Visual Debug Test (`debug_springs_test`)

- **Key 1**: Toggle skeleton springs (red) on/off
- **Key 2**: Toggle flesh springs (cyan) on/off
- **Key 3**: Toggle point numbers for debugging
- **WASD**: Move the character
- **Space**: Jump
- **W**: Trigger wave animation
- **R**: Reset position
- **Esc**: Exit

### What to Look For

1. **Red springs**: Should form the basic human skeleton shape
2. **Cyan springs**: Should connect interior mesh points to nearby skeleton joints
3. **Movement**: Skeleton should hold the overall pose while flesh deforms naturally
4. **Physics**: Character should be more stable but still bouncy

## Files Modified

- `jelly.hpp`: Added `connect_flesh_to_skeleton()` method and integration
- `Player.cpp`: Added skeleton creation call in `create_figure()`
- `debug_springs_test.cpp`: New visual debugging tool

## Success Criteria Met

✅ High-stiffness skeleton layer preserves human shape  
✅ Soft flesh mesh remains attached to skeleton  
✅ Two-tier stiffness system (strong skeleton, soft flesh)  
✅ BODY_PART tagging and per-player ID system maintained  
✅ Visual debugging tools for inspection  
✅ Code compiles and runs without errors

The system now provides the structural integrity you wanted while maintaining the fun, bouncy physics of the soft-body simulation!
