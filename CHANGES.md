## Purpose

Quick human-readable audit of recent manual and AI-driven edits so you can track, commit, and continue iterating safely.

Files you edited recently (manual + AI):

- Jiggly Jam/Game Settings/settings.json
  - Added Phase 2: Physics-driven walking settings and many comments describing behavior.
- .vscode/tasks.json
  - Replaced complex shell wrapper with two simple tasks: Build and Run that include settings_perser.cpp.
- Jiggly Jam/Libraries/settings_perser.hpp
  - Added Phase 2 structs (PhysicsDrivenWalking) and new nested parsers; cleaned some struct layout.
- Jiggly Jam/Libraries/settings_perser.cpp
  - Updated parser fallback defaults for lift/swing/plant forces and implemented walking-related parse helpers.
- Jiggly Jam/Libraries/Player/Player.hpp
  - Reduced many movement/wave force constants; exposed physics tuning fields.
- Jiggly Jam/Libraries/Player/Player.cpp
  - Large refactor: added physics-driven walking hookup, reduced force magnitudes, tuned PD gains, fixed settings application.
- Jiggly Jam/Libraries/Gmae_physics/jelly.hpp
  - Added walking state struct and new walking method declarations.
- Jiggly Jam/Libraries/Gmae_physics/jelly.cpp
  - Implemented Phase 2 walking system: gait, COM dynamics, weight shifting, arm swing, hip sway, and safety fallbacks.
- (Deleted) Several old/duplicate header files (jelly_clean.hpp, jelly_old.hpp) and test_fixes.cpp.

Build & Runtime status (checked in this session):

- Build: SUCCESS (g++ -std=c++17 -O2) with minor narrowing warnings in jelly.cpp (float/double). No link errors after including settings_perser.cpp.
- Run: Smoke run executed (14s) with normal startup logs; exited due to timeout (no crash).

Recommended next steps (pick and I can perform any):

1. Create a single atomic git commit with a clear message summarizing these edits. (I can run this for you.)
2. Produce a more detailed CHANGELOG entry (per file, per function) if you want a developer-facing log.
3. Add a tiny smoke-test script (scripts/smoke_test.sh) that builds + runs briefly and returns non-zero on crash.
4. Fix narrowing warnings (small casts) in jelly.cpp.
5. Run a longer interactive test and record a short video/log (if you want to QA behavior).

## Suggested commit message

"feat(physics): add Phase-2 physics-driven walking, tune forces for stability, and wire settings parser; update tasks.json"

## Commands you can run locally to review and commit

# Show unstaged changes

git status --porcelain -b

# Stage everything you want to commit (review before running)

git add -A

# Create a single descriptive commit

git commit -m "feat(physics): add Phase-2 physics-driven walking, tune forces for stability, and wire settings parser"

# Optional: push to origin

# git push origin HEAD

If you'd like, I can create and run a smoke-test script now, or make the commit for you. Which action should I take next?
